								<h2 class="major">My Servers</h2>
								<p>I have a bunch of servers running on random hardware accessible to me and my friends and family. I'll go through some of them here.</p>
								<h3><a href="#kavita">Kavita</a></h3>
								<p>Kavita is an ebook hosting server that acts like the kindle website for you personal ebooks and comics. </p>
								<h3><a href="#navidrome">Navidrome</a></h3>
								<p>Navidrome serves your own music files. Once it's set up, you put your music files in the directory and you can access them through the web or with whatever client you like.</p>
								<h3><a href="#gramps-web">Gramps Web</a></h3>
								<p>Gramps Web is an ancestry server where you can store your family tree and even dna if you want to. I like it because I don't want my family data in the hands of weirdos like ancestry.com.</p>
								<h3><a href="#foundry">Foundry VTT</a></h3>
								<p>Foundry is a self hostable virtual tabletop used by geeks to play DnD type games online.</p>
								<h3><a href="#ntfy">NTFY</a></h3>
								<p>NTFY is a useful server that you can use to send notifications from your server to your devices.</p>
								<h3><a href="#beaver">Beaver Habbits</a></h3>
								<p>Beaver Habbit Tracker is a simlipstic web server that helps you track your habbits.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/kavita_main.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p><a href="https://www.kavitareader.com/" target="_blank">Kavita</a> is a self hostable ebook server that you can set up on a raspberry pi to read books and comics while you should be doing other things (at least that's how I use it).</p>
									<p>Here's a link to the <a href="https://www.kavitareader.com/#demo" target="_blank">official demo</a>, if you'd like to see about setting up a server of your own, there's a nice <a href="https://wiki.kavitareader.com/getting-started/" target="_blank">wiki</a> and a great <a href="https://discord.com/invite/kavita-821879810934439936" target="_blank">Discord community</a>.</p>

							<!-- Navidrome -->
								<article id="navidrome">
									<h2 class="major">Navidrome</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/navidrome_main.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p><a href="https://www.navidrome.org/" target="_blank">Navidrome</a> is a nifty music server that you can use to stream your old iTunes m4a files for sentimentality. Or, if you like collecting your favorite music in hi-fi quality like me, you can use it to server flac files from Qobuz. Either way, there's a certain romance that comes with Navidrome and that's what I like about it.</p>
									<p>There are many clients for Navidrome, including one really great iOS app called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arpeggiApp/" target="_blank">Arpeggi</a>. It is still in beta, so you'll need to install it via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/LDWqgjAs" target="_blank">testflight</a>.</p>
									<p>One aspect of Navidrome I struggled with was the way it handles metadata. Having previously used Plex, it was weird that some of the metadata and artwork didn't populate correctly, and at first I just went right back to Plex. I gave it another shot one day, and after editing my music files' metadata with <a href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/" target="_blank">mp3tag</a>, I was able to clean up the navigation so there weren't a hundred albums under "various artists" lol. Along the way I learned there are a few tricks to how Navidrome handles album and artist artwork differently from Plex, I find it's best to name all the artwork folder.jpg haha. Anyways, here are some <a href="#navidrome-tips">tips</a>.</p>
									<p>If this sounds like too much work to you I reccommend you just use Plex with the PlexAmp app (which is almost as beautiful as Arpeggi btw). There are a lot of features locked behind the subscription to the Plex Pass, but it's a super smooth experience.</p>

							<!-- Navidrome Tips -->
								<article id="navidrome-tips">
									<h2 class="major">Navidrome Tips</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>When I was setting up Navidrome, I had two main problems:
										<br>	1. My metadata was a little out of order, so my artists folder was messed up. 
										<br>	2. The artwork I had wasn't being read properly like it had been in Plex.
									</p>
									<h3>Metadata</h3>
									<p>To fix the metadata, I used a tool called mp3tag. There are similar tools for linux, but mp3tag is the best one, so use that one lol. To begin with, I made a list of all the artists and albums within them that needed fixing. With mp3tag, while editing the relevant files, use Alt+T to show the extended tags. THIS IS WHAT TRIPPED ME UP FOR SO LONG LMAO. You wouldn't think they would matter, but sometimes they do, and Navidrome gets tripped up on these tags.</p>
									<h3>Artwork</h3>
									<p>To fix the artwork, the main problem I noticed was that albums with "disc" subfolders didn't have artwork. With albums like this, I put the artwork in each directory, including both discs and the root directory of the album. This works for me, and I don't feel like finding which specific folder it reads the artwork from. 
									<br>Other than that, I found that if I had multiple albums in an artist and one of the albums didn't have artwork, it was usually because of the file name. For example, in The Beatles, if you have album.jpgs in each album except for With The Beatles, the artwork for With The Beatles might not show up. My fix for this was to just name all the artwork folder.extension lol.

								<!-- Gramps Web -->
								<article id="gramps-web">
									<h2 class="major">Gramps Web</h2>
									<p><a href="https://www.grampsweb.org/" target="_blank">Gramps Web</a> is a self hostable ancestry archiving server, like ancestry.com but hosted by you so you know where all your data is. I'm using this to build up my family tree because I know I'll probably care about this stuff one day lol.</p>
									<p>Here's the link to the <a href="https://demo.grampsweb.org/login" target="_blank">demo</a>, the username and password are both "owner." If you're already using another ancestry site to do these things, you should know that it's not as hard as you'd think to transfer your data into Gramps Web. </p>
									<p>Here's the official <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gramps-project/gramps-web-docs/main/examples/docker-compose-base/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank">docker-compose.yml</a> file.</p>

								<!-- Foundry -->
								<article id="foundry">
									<h2 class="major">Foundry Virtual Tabletop</h2>
									<p><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/" target="_blank">Foundry</a> is my favorite virtual tabletop, even if I wasn't considering the fact that you can self-host it. The alternative for me was roll20, and the difference between the two is like night and day. Not only are there way more cool features in Foundry, but there's also many open source mods you can use (and or buy) to enhance your gameplay. In my opinion, it is well worth it to buy and host Foundry if you're into that sort of thing lol.</p>
								</article>

								<!-- NTFY -->
								<article id="ntfy">
									<h2 class="major">NTFY</h2>
									<p><a href="https://ntfy.sh/" target="_blank">NTFY</a> is incredibly useful because it lets you send notifications to your devices. Normally this wouldn't be all that special, but that's not the only cool part. It also lets you send push notifications to Apple devices :D. Along with the fact that it's relatively simple to set up, I really love this project. </p>
									<p>One problem I had with NTFY is that for an embarrassing amount of time I couldn't find the correct AUR to install it. There are a couple different ones, ntfy, ntfy-git, ntfy-alertmanager, ntfysh, and ntfsh-bin. The correct one turned out to be <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ntfysh-bin" target="_blank">ntfysh-bin</a> lol.</p>

								<p>I'm not a big social media guy, and by that I mean I mostly doomscroll on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tristan.network" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> without posting much. I also have a <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tryst1129" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> account, but I never go on there.</p>
